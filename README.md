# TRD-OSL

A simple app that I use for keeping track of my jogging challenge. The goal
is to jog the distance between Trondheim and Oslo (via HÃ¸nefoss).

I have -- by hand -- drawn a polyline in Google Maps following the road between
the three cities. The polyline is updated as I log more entries, and it will
show my position on the map itself.

See [_scripts/](https://github.com/OptimusCrime/trdosl/tree/master/_scripts) for some utility scripts that I used.
